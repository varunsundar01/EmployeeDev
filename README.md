# EmployeeDev

## About 
I created this project in my spare time after work using Vue.js and Django. You can create your own account to submit project ideas and also view the projects submitted by other employees. In a way, this is my way to optimize an existing process and keep thinking how to do something better.

## Background
My day job requires every employee to submit new ideas or processes that could improve how things are done currently. All this is handled in excel and sent over email which is quite tedious. It requires a person to dedicate a few hours every week to maintaining the system and reviewing forms sent by email.

Right before COVID, I had proposed moving the whole system to have it hosted on the web. This way every employee can sign in, enter their proposed projects, and the backend would take care of the number of points and most of the data validation. The supervisors would just have to meet once a month to go over the projects submitted by their employees. Ever since COVID this plan was kept on the back burner to focus on other direct revenue projects.
