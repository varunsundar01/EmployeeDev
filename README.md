## About EmployeeDev
I created EmployeeDev using Vue.js and Django Rest Framework. 

With EmployeeDev you can create your own account to submit project proposals and also view proposals submitted by other employees at your company. Once you submit your project proposal you can update project parameters and also delete any project you have submitted. This is one way to streamline and collect every employees voice who actively contributes to making an organization great. 

EmployeeDev is also fully equipped to verify and activate your email and help you reset your account password.

## Why did I make this?
My day job requires every employee to submit new ideas or processes that could improve how things are done currently. All this is handled in excel and sent over email which is quite tedious and tough to track. Emails and attachments tend to get lost when every employee is giving their best at the workplace and attending to issues higher up on their priority list. The current system requires a person to dedicate a few hours every week to maintaining the system and reviewing forms sent by email.

Right before COVID, I had proposed moving the whole system to have it hosted on the web. This way every employee can sign in, enter their proposed projects, and the app would take care of keeping a log of how many projects an employee has submitted and most of the data validation. The supervisors would just have to meet once a month to go over the projects submitted by their employees. Accumulating all ideas submitted by employees can help the supervisors make better decisions regarding implementation and also employee performance. Ever since COVID this plan was kept on the back burner to focus on other direct revenue projects. Nevertheless, I was determined to create this in my free time after work. 

In a way, this is my way to optimize an existing process and keep thinking how to do something better.
